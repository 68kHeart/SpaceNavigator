MonoLibUsb
This dll actually succeeded in getting data from the space navigator.
For this to work, its dependency libusb-1.0.dll had to be copied to project root dir or the Unity executable dir (plugins folder doesn't work).
Implemented a worker thread to read data.
Implemented editor scene view navigation.
Still has some issues: 
- Can't find the right spot to zero the data, resulting in drifting when user stops navigating.
- Editor scene view rotation is simply setting the quaternion, so roll axis is active and no helicopter-mode.

TDx
This method uses COM, which isn't supported in mono.

HID
This method uses Windows Forms, which is supported in mono, but not the version that Unity uses.

3DxWare joystick mapping
The 3DxWare driver contains an USB joystick proxy device.
This driver is configured according to which application has focus.
So far there is data coming in, but there's a couple of issues :
- Only positive values are received, regardless of which direction the device is moved.
- In rest position the values are not zeroed.

smcs.rsp, this file should make unsafe code easier to use, haven't seen any change.
